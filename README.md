# Library-management

 I am created a simple Python program that simulates a library system with two classes, "library" and "customer," and an interactive menu for users to perform various actions. It allows customers to borrow and return books from the library.

 # Library Management System

## Introduction
This Python program simulates a basic library management system. It consists of two main classes, "library" and "customer," that enable users to interact with the library by borrowing and returning books. This README file provides an overview of how to use the program and the functionality it offers.

## Classes
### `library` Class
- The `library` class represents the library's side of the system.
- It maintains a list of available books and provides functions to display the book list, lend a book to a customer, and accept book returns.

### `customer` Class
- The `customer` class represents a library customer.
- It allows customers to add books to their personal collection, view their collection, request books from the library, and return books to the library.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script by executing the following command:

python library_management.py

2. You will be presented with a menu of options to choose from:
- Option 1: Show the list of books in the library.
- Option 2: Lend a book from the library.
- Option 3: View your personal book collection.
- Option 4: Return a book to the library.
- Option 0: Exit the program.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the program:
1. Select option 1 to view the list of available books in the library.
2. Select option 2 to borrow a book by entering its name.
3. Select option 3 to view your personal book collection.
4. Select option 4 to return a book to the library.
5. Select option 0 to exit the program.

## Note
- Make sure to customize the initial book list in the `lib_cbe` object to match the books available in your library.
- This program does not include any persistent storage for book records; it's a simple simulation.

Feel free to modify and enhance the program to suit your specific needs.
